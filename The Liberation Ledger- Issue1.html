    <h1>The Hand That Feeds</h1>
    <h2>How Capitalism Devalues Care Work While Depending on It for Survival</h2>
  </header>

  <article>
    <section>
      <p>Beneath the gleam of skyscrapers and the fevered hum of stock markets pulses a quieter, more essential labor: care work. The paradox is glaring but rarely acknowledged — capitalism, for all its idolization of productivity and profit, is entirely dependent on the daily, sometimes invisible, labor of caregivers: nurses, teachers, childcare workers, home health aides, cleaning staff, and countless others whose work sustains social and biological life. Yet, in the late capitalist era, we witness a fresh assault: the declassification and delegitimization of these professions, even as the market heaps legitimacy and reward upon profit-driven occupations. Contemporary capitalism not only undervalues care work but systemically undermines its legitimacy, despite its existential indispensability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The Architecture of Disregard</h3>
      <p>Capitalism’s foundational premise is straightforward: value is determined by what can be bought and sold. But what happens when the most vital work — feeding, teaching, healing, nurturing — cannot be efficiently monetized? The answer is a social and economic order that simultaneously relies on and relegates care. Wages for care workers trail far behind those in finance, technology, or management, even as demand for their labor rises in aging societies, in schools, hospitals, and homes.</p>
      <p>During COVID-19, it became vogue to call healthcare workers “heroes,” but society quickly revealed the limits of its gratitude. “Hero” is a cheap wage supplement. Once the clapping faded, the underpayment, overwork, and disregard returned. As soon as the market’s machinery could grind back to “normal,” those who kept it running were thanked, patted on the back, and ushered back to the shadows. What capitalism cannot commodify, it is eager to ignore, or worse, exploit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Declassification: Stripping Legitimacy, Eroding Security</h3>
      <p>Now, a subtler and more insidious shift is underway: the “declassification” of care work. Roles once understood as skilled and indispensable are bureaucratically recast as “unskilled” or “entry-level.” With the stroke of a pen, classroom aides, elder care workers, and even some nursing staff are recategorized — benefits evaporate, protections wane. This isn’t just a matter of wages; it is a calculated erosion of dignity and legitimacy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the market lionizes the profit-chasers: investment bankers, consultants, tech entrepreneurs. Occupations that extract value — often by leveraging or outright exploiting the labor of caregivers — are dubbed “real” work. The supposed meritocracy of the market turns out to be a hierarchy of profit extraction, not social necessity.</p>
      <p>Who built the “meritocracy,” anyway? The financiers and founders, those titans of capitalism, are products of years — decades — of care. The invisible scaffolding of meals cooked, wounds tended, children raised, classrooms managed, homes kept afloat — all of it paved the way for their ascension. How do we honor the hands that feed, heal, and nurture? By demoting them, cutting their pay, and calling it “fiscal responsibility.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Dependency Denied</h3>
      <p>Here lies the tragicomic irony: capitalism cannot survive without care work. The corporate class, the innovators, the entire workforce — they all depend on a web of invisible, feminized, often racialized labor. Yet the market, ever eager to talk about “value creation,” systematically denies its dependency.</p>
      <p>This isn’t some unfortunate oversight; it is structural. As care work grows more precarious, it becomes the substrate upon which capitalism’s glitzy facade is built. Underpaying care workers is not enough; the system demands their delegitimization, their consignment to an underclass of “unskilled labor.” Care work is not merely forgotten — it is actively erased from the narrative of value.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Reclaiming Legitimacy: Toward a Politics of Care</h3>
      <p>Addressing this contradiction is not simply about justice for care workers — it is about our collective future. Declassifying and delegitimizing care work is a political act: it suppresses the forms of labor that resist total commodification and, in so doing, suppresses our shared humanity.</p>
      <p>If we are to survive, let alone thrive, we must demand more than wage increases. We must revalorize care — not as a side effect of “real” work, but as the foundation of civilized life. This requires dismantling the dogma that profit alone justifies value.</p>
      <blockquote>The hand that feeds is tired of being bitten.</blockquote>
      <p>Will we finally value the work that keeps us alive, or continue to worship the altar of profit — hungry, sick, and alone?</p>
